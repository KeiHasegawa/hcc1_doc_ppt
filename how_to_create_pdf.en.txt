(1) Install W32TeX. I assume that you install it into C:\w32tex.

(2) Execute below `twice' at folder where you uncompressed doc.tar.bz2
> C:\w32tex\bin\platex.exe c_compiler_e.tex
If you do just once, reference part remains `??'.

(3) Convert dvi file to ps file
> C:\w32tex\bin\dvi2ps.exe c_compiler_e.dvi > c_compiler_e.ps

(4) Convert ps file to pdf file
Open c_compiler_e.ps with GSView and execute Convert menu of File.
Select pdfwrite at Device and 600 at Resolution, and push Ok.
